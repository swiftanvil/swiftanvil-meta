# Host-Agnostic Memory System — SwiftAnvil

> Structured, loadable instructions that any LLM can read and follow. No inference drift. No forgotten policies.

---

## Core Principle

**LLMs have no memory between sessions.** The only memory is the files we write. If a policy is not in a file that gets read at session start, it does not exist for the AI.

This system ensures:
- Every session starts with the same context
- Policies are enforced, not suggested
- No host-specific knowledge is required
- Any capable LLM can be the builder or reviewer

---

## Memory Structure

The memory is a **hierarchy** — each level overrides the one above for its scope.

```
MEMORY/
├── memory.meta              ← How to use this memory system
├── memory.identity          ← Who we are, what we build
├── policy.platform   ← OS support, API modernization (policy.platform)
├── workflow.orchestration     ← How we work (workflow.orchestration)
├── improvement.framework       ← How we improve (improvement.framework)
├── agents.compatibility        ← How any capable agent can participate
├── agents.diagnostics          ← How to diagnose agent and reviewer failures
├── quality.standards           ← Code quality standards
├── modernization.api ← What to modernize (modernization.api)
├── packages.registry          ← Package registry with current scores
└── meta.session-start     ← Checklist for every new session
```

### Loading Order

At session start, the AI **must** read files in this order:

1. `memory.meta` — understand the system
2. `memory.identity` — understand the project
3. `policy.platform` — know what OS/APIs to target
4. `workflow.orchestration` — know the workflow
5. `improvement.framework` — know how to improve
6. `agents.compatibility` — know agent-agnostic contribution rules
7. `agents.diagnostics` — know how to diagnose reviewer failures
8. `packages.registry` — know current package health
9. `meta.session-start` — execute the startup checklist

**Total read time:** ~2 minutes. **Total context used:** ~500 lines.

## File Format Rules

Every memory file follows strict formatting so LLMs parse it reliably:

### 1. Frontmatter

```markdown
---
priority: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
type: POLICY | WORKFLOW | REFERENCE | CHECKLIST
audience: BUILDER | REVIEWER | BOTH
last_updated: 2026-06-04
---
```

### 2. One Idea Per Section

```markdown
## Section Title

> One-sentence summary of the rule.

Details here. Keep paragraphs short.

### Enforcement
How this is enforced. Specific commands, checks, or consequences.

### Example
```swift
// Good: follows the rule
let modern = newAPI()

// Bad: violates the rule
let legacy = oldAPI() // ❌ Deprecated in iOS 18
```
```

### 3. Tables for Reference Data

```markdown
| Platform | Minimum | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| iOS | 18.0 | No iOS 17 support |
```

### 4. Checklists for Actions

```markdown
- [ ] Read policy.platform
- [ ] Verify Package.swift platforms
```

### 5. No Ambiguity

- Use **must** for requirements
- Use **should** for strong recommendations
- Use **may** for optional things
- Never use "consider", "think about", "maybe"

# How to Use This Memory System

## For AI Builders

1. At session start, read files 00-07 in order
2. Before writing code, read policy.platform
3. Before reviewing, read workflow.orchestration
4. After completing work, update packages.registry

## For AI Reviewers

1. Read policy.platform — check for violations
2. Read quality.standards — check standards
3. Read modernization.api — check for old APIs

## For Humans

1. Edit any file to update policy
2. The AI will read the updated version next session
3. No restart or notification needed

## File Update Rules

- Update `last_updated` when changing a file
- Add version history at bottom
- Never delete sections — mark deprecated instead
```

## memory.identity

```markdown
---
priority: CRITICAL
type: REFERENCE
audience: BOTH
last_updated: 2026-06-04

# SwiftAnvil Identity

## What We Build

SwiftAnvil is a suite of Swift packages for building modern Apple platform apps. We prioritize:

1. **Latest OS first** — iOS 18+, macOS 15+, etc.
2. **Swift 6 strict concurrency** — no exceptions
3. **Zero dependencies** where possible — pure Swift + Foundation
4. **Test-driven** — every public API has tests
5. **DocC-documented** — every public symbol

## What We Don't Do

- Support old OS versions (see policy.platform)
- Use deprecated APIs (see modernization.api)
- Add dependencies for trivial functionality
- Skip cross-host review
- Merge without tests passing

## Org Structure

- GitHub: github.com/swiftanvil
- Naming: swiftanvil-anvil-<name>
- License: MIT
```

# Session Start Checklist

Every session begins here. Do not skip steps.

## Step 1: Load Memory (2 min)

- [ ] Read memory.meta
- [ ] Read memory.identity
- [ ] Read policy.platform
- [ ] Read workflow.orchestration
- [ ] Read improvement.framework
- [ ] Read packages.registry

## Step 2: Check Health (1 min)

- [ ] Any package score < 80? → Improvement sprint first
- [ ] Any blocked items? → Check if unblocked
- [ ] Any stale branches? → Clean up

## Step 3: Plan Work (2 min)

- [ ] Read roadmap.org for planned child
- [ ] Check if dependencies need updating
- [ ] Verify platform requirements match policy

## Step 4: Execute

Proceed with planned work, following workflow.orchestration.

## Step 5: Update Memory (1 min)

- [ ] Update packages.registry if scores changed
- [ ] Update modernization.api if old APIs found
- [ ] Commit all memory changes
```

## Physical Layout

In the repo, the memory lives at:

```
iFoundation/
├── MEMORY/
│   ├── memory.meta
│   ├── memory.identity
│   ├── policy.platform      ← symlink to ../policy.platform
│   ├── workflow.orchestration        ← symlink to ../workflow.orchestration
│   ├── improvement.framework          ← symlink to ../improvement.framework
│   ├── quality.standards              ← TBD
│   ├── modernization.api    ← symlink to ../modernization.api
│   ├── packages.registry             ← generated from package.improvement-score
│   └── meta.session-start
```

Symlinks ensure single source of truth. The MEMORY directory is the **loadable interface**.

## Why This Prevents Drift

| Without Memory System | With Memory System |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| AI forgets OS policy | AI reads policy.platform every session |
| AI uses deprecated APIs | AI checks modernization.api before coding |
| AI skips review | AI follows `workflow.orchestration` checklist |
| AI builds wrong thing | AI reads `memory.identity` and `packages.registry` first |
| Different AIs behave differently | All AIs load the same memory |

---

*The memory is the project. The AI is just the executor.*
