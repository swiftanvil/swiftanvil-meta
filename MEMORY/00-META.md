# How to Use This Memory System

## For AI Builders

1. At session start, resolve `meta.session-start` from `meta.registry`
2. Before writing code, read `policy.platform`
3. Before reviewing, read `workflow.orchestration`
4. After completing work, update `packages.registry`

## For AI Reviewers

1. Read `policy.platform` and check for violations
2. Read `quality.standards` and check standards
3. Read `modernization.api` and check for old APIs

## For Humans

1. Edit any file to update policy
2. The AI will read the updated version next session
3. No restart or notification needed

## File Update Rules

- Update `last_updated` when changing a file
- Add version history at bottom
- Never delete sections — mark deprecated instead
