- [ ] `improvement.framework`
- [ ] `packages.registry`

## Step 2: Check Health (1 min)

- [ ] Any package score < 80? → Improvement sprint first

## Step 3: Plan Work (2 min)

- [ ] Read `roadmap.org` for planned child
- [ ] Check if dependencies need updating
- [ ] Verify platform requirements match policy (iOS 18+, macOS 15+)

## Step 5: Update Memory (1 min)

- [ ] Update `packages.registry` if scores changed
- [ ] Update `naming.registry` if names changed
